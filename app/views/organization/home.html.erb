      What is <span class="wildFire">WILD FIRE</span>? It's is a variety of things. It might be described as a community or activist group, or maybe it’s

      a bit like pay it forward. The truth is, it is a lot of different things, and that’s part of what makes us

      different. Every event we organize is unique from the last. Every kind act we require from friends is

      specifically designed for them. We focus on touching people’s lives in unique creative ways that bring

      Friends invite friends. This means you know people

      and you get to have a great time while supporting a positive cause. We believe in fun because if it’s not

      Imagine a world where people were brought together by values instead of segregated by them. That’s

      us. We come from a variety of backgrounds, ethnicities, and religious faiths because it’s not our

      differences that connect us but our core belief in each other.

      So go out there one friend at a time and SPARK their interest. Together we make a difference.
