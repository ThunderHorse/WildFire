        Welcome to Wildfire!!! We are excited to have you join us on our quest to change the world. We all

        give what we can, when we can and how we can.

        Wildfire is a variety of things. It might be described as a community or activist group, or maybe it’s

        a bit like pay it forward. The truth is, it is a lot of different things, and that’s part of what makes us

        different. Every event we organize is unique from the last; every kind act we require from friends is

        specifically designed for them. We focus on touching people’s lives in unique creative ways that bring

        our community together.

        Anyone can go volunteer so why choose Wildfire? Friends invite friends. This means you know people

        and you get to have a great time while supporting a positive cause. We believe in fun because if it’s not

        fun, you won’t be back!

        Imagine a world where people were brought together by values instead of segregated by them. That’s

        us. We come from a variety of backgrounds, ethnicities, and religious faiths because it’s not our

        differences that connect us but our core belief in each other.

        So go out there one friend at a time and SPARK their interest. Together we make a difference.
