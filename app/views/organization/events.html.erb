Olympics - Make Us Different. We are thrilled to be apart of the 13th Annual SummerFest, one of this year's largest outings for "Bigs" and "Littles". <span class="wildFire">WILD FIRE</span> will be hosting a variety of events to promote team building, sportsmanship, and confidence. It's going to be a great day of fun in the sun and mud. We're calling out <span class="wildFire">WILD FIRE</span> members in full force.

       Strawberry Fields Forever! We had a great time at the 2014 Strawberry Jam and Craft Fair hosted by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.watermansfamilyfarm.com">Waterman's Family Farm</a>. <span class="wildFire">WILD FIRE</span> had the pleasure of hosting the "Shortcake Obstacle Race." A lot of people in central Indiana may recall a fond memory of heading out to the pumpkin patch or strawberry field at Waterman's. We enjoyed some strawberries and helped give several children a great experience to look back on for years to come.

        <h2>Farming Trash Treasures</h2>
        <h3>03 - 29 - 2014</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="p-right">
        We had the wonderful opportunity to team up with
        <a target="_blank" href="http://indyparksfoundation.org/site/what_we_do/indy_urban_acres_farm">Indy Urban Acres</a>, an Indianapolis
        based organization that has supported the local community by donating over 30,000 pounds of fresh produce. They also provide youth
        workshops to educate children about how their food gets from the farm to their plate. Our volunteers recycled old wooden pallets
        that were originally set out for the trash.  <span class="wildFire">WILD FIRE</span> transformed them into sustainable park benches
        for bright young minds to build an appreciation for farming for years to come.

        <h3>02 - 08 - 2014</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="p-right">
        During the harsh Indiana winter of 2014, <span class="wildFire">WILD FIRE</span> jumped into action by helping local Hoosiers
        become mobile again. We shoveled driveways at random for anyone who needed it. Our aim was to ease the burden of Winter's bite, inspire others
        to pay it forward, and Spark Love.

      <p class="p-right">
        We gathered as friends to give back to our community. Each one of us donated an item we felt would be useful to those in need.
        What we gave was from our heart. The items ranged from absolute everyday necesseties to items that were simply meant to inspire
        and leave the recipient with a positive feeling. Our goal with this event was to let people who needed it know that they are appreciated
        and someone cares.
